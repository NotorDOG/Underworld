Post-Motem
For what I feel that I did on this project. I accomplished what I set out on doing with the main mechanics of the game. This game was a joy to work on and was a learning experience that I won't forget. I didn't have trouble with most of what I wanted in the game, more or less it was the amount of content that I wanted to add in that could have been changed because the game in its state is pretty lack luster of an ending and felt rushed in the end. During the break, I hope that I put some effort into elaborating on the game more and implement some new features that would make the game more enjoyable and special to itself. For the next time that I would work on a project like this, I would like to divide some of the tasks that I wanted to do into smaller bits so that I don't work on everything at the last second. I would also want to proof some of the code to enhance its readability since I believe that it could be reduced to an even neater form that would look nicer than what I have. I was also unable to make more than 1 enemy but, in the future, I hope that I can add bosses that also have the adrenaline bar making fighting bosses more challenging and interesting. Overall, I hope that I did well on this game, and it shows the journey that I took to completing this game and spark a new hobby that I can indulge in for my free time to be productive.
