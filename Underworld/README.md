# Underworld
 
1a. The genre will be a bullet hell shooter, mixed with a bit of platforming.  You were tasked by a group of cave explorers to delve into the cave that is rumored to lead to the underworld.  It will take place in the cave leading to the rumored "Underworld". Along with the quest to the Underworld, you will be exploring this cave, dodging enemies and finding treasures that will aid you in your endeavors. You will meet allies along your trip that will provide new weapons that will be useful for certain situations. 

Inspirations
1b. 
	-Cave Story: I wanted to utilize the mechanics of leveling up your weapons which will lead to stronger attacks in addition to losing levels on your weapons based on how much damage you take. 
	-Deltarune: I loved that they incorporated a system that involves barely dodging attacks to use for your attacks. So I intend to meld both Cave Story and Deltarunes mechanics. I might have taken some inspiration unintentionally from Undertale as well. 
	-Terraria- Calamity Mod: The concept of Adrenaline was what motivated me to combine both Cave Story and Deltarunes mechanics where you dodge attacks to fill the adrenaline bar from not getting hit by a boss, and you can activate it once its full to deal massive amounts of damage.  

Features: 
1. Guns: There will always be guns in this game, but I might incorporate a gun tree in which you can swap guns with your allies as you traverse the cave (inspired by Cave Story Gun). I.e. If you keep a gun that is weak, you might be rewarded with an ever better gun in the future of the game. 
2. "Adrenaline": In the game, you dodge attacks and gain adrenaline". The more shots you dodge, the stronger the attacks you deal. Once you are dealt damage, you will lose some adrenaline making your attacks weaker. For bosses the same will apply to bosses where missing shots will punish the player with even stronger and faster attacks. Might be renamed to something else.  
3. *Spells (Might not implement): You can cast spells with the adrenaline you obtain, this could buff your gun, heal you, damage enemies, whatever you can do. Since it will use adrenaline, you are sacrificing some of your adrenaline used for your guns for bettering your ability to play. Requires for user to hotkey the spells and items that they would like to use. 
4. Shop: This is where you would get items that will aid you in your quest.
